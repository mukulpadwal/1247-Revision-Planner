This App is based on The Secret of Successful Revision: 1247 Memory Technique.

Generally, during preparation for exams, students spend 10-12 hours in a day on various topics.
After the 1st study, since students get familiar with the topics, they ignore to revise it again.
A study says, we tend to forget 3/4th (about 75%) of what we have studied if we do not revise it within next 24 hours.
This is where 1247 technique can be most beneficial for students.

# What is 1247 Technique?
Ans: Its a memory technique wherein you should revise whatever you have studied thrice after the 1st study.
So effectively, you will study 4 times in 1-2-4-7 order.
Initial study on the first day.(1)
Revision on the next day after 1st study.(2)
Again on the 4th day.(4)
Again on the 7th day.(7)

# Will it take more time to study?
Since the concepts are familiar, it will take less time to revise.
For the 1st revision, it will take around 1 hour.
2nd Revision will take around 25-30 minutes.
3rd Revision around 5 minutes.
As you keep re-visiting the topics, you save your precious time and also there will be less pressure on your brain.
